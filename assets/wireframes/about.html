			<h2>xander situ</h2>
			
			<p>"I've always had a love for music. Whether it be writing out lyrics or mixing music. I knew I always wanted to be involved in the music world. Being born in such a small city, I felt restricted to the culture of music. Ottawa is a small crowd. That's why I'm always expanding my music knowledge on the Internet. Always on YouTube or SoundCloud. I like to look for music that these big name DJs play. I try to find new ways to learn to play the same way these guys do. A-Trak, Avicii, DJ AM, Swedish House Mafia. They're all inspirations to me. They're all amazing at what they do. Each with different music and playing styles. I've taken all of it in and came out with my own way of playing music. It's bits and pieces from what I've gathered. DJ Biggs and I created this duo called the "Black Ninjas" because we wanted to be different from most of these DJs. We vibe together and our ideas are very much alike. Because of our similar ideas, we can work with 4 different tracks and create mash ups on the fly. We work off ofeach other's creativity. I guess it's true what they say. Two heads are better than one."</p>

			<p>"My passion for music started when I was very young I picked up music very early with no problems. My first instrument was the violin. I started playing drums and brass music, which both are huge parts of my life. I always wanted to learn something new, that's why I started DJing about six years ago. I learned a lot of forms of different genres and how to play them. I incorporate this knowledge through DJing to connect with the crowd. My biggest strength is connecting with what I feel through music as I watch the reaction through people as I'm playing live. My biggest influences are DJ Qbert, DJ AM, and DJ jazzy Jeff. The most important part of DJing is having the right people around to influence me in a positive way, so I can continue to make music."</p>
